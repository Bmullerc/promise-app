      <p className="mt-4">Following the idea of my last learning project <a href="https://hoowks.netlify.app/" className="hover:text-purple-400 font-bold">Hoowks</a>, this is a mix of studying and applying the knowledge that I learn, with a pinch of experimentation and trial and error along the way.</p>
      <p>The main focus of this project is to study <strong>Asynchronous Javascript Methods</strong> and <strong>API Fetching</strong>.</p>
