      <p>e<strong>X</strong>tensible <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage (XML) is a generic markup language specified by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium). The information technology industry uses many languages based on XML as data-description languages.</p>
      <p>XML tags resemble HTML tags, but XML is much more flexible because it lets users define their own tags. In this way XML acts like a meta-language, that is, it can be used to define other languages, such as RSS. Moreover, HTML is a presentation language, whereas XML is a data-description language. This means that XML has far broader applications than just the Web. For example, Web services can use XML to exchange requests and responses.</p>
